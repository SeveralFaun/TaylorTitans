Unfinished Java Project that was meant to be a simple Java version of Super Smash Bros.

Worked with Zaid Alsadoon to create. It is a very early version of the game, with the only current functionality being to move two squares (character selectors) on the screen using asdf and directional keys. (Press x to start, click on the square in the top left then the character selectors will appear). That was meant to be the character select screen, where players would move their selector over character icons to select the character for the game.

Project was created to apply Object oriented programming.
